# Feyman Learning Technique

## Feyman Learning Technique:
### Teach it to a child 
In order to hide our lack of understanding, we use complicated vocabulary and jargon as one of the tricks we use. 
Writing out an idea from start to finish in simple language that a child can understand forces you to understand it at a deeper level and simplify relationships and connections.

### Review
Identifying the boundaries of your understanding also limits the mistakes youâ€™re liable to make and increases your chance of success when applying knowledge.

### Organize and Simplify
After a few rounds of simplifying and reducing jargon, you will have well-crafted notes that will be easy to read and understand. Make it simple for yourself to tell the story by organizing the information into a simple narrative. Read it loudly.
